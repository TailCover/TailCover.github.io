    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

    <p>
      These Terms of Service govern your use of the Cover Your Tails application
      and related services. By using the app, you agree to these terms.
    </p>

    <h2>The service</h2>
    <p>
      Cover Your Tails provides a user-configured check-in and notification
      service. The app sends reminders and messages based on the schedules,
      settings, and instructions you define.
    </p>

    <h2>Not an emergency or monitoring service</h2>
    <p>
      Cover Your Tails is not an emergency response service, medical service, or
      monitoring service. The app does not contact emergency responders and does
      not guarantee outcomes, responses, or user safety.
    </p>

    <h2>User responsibilities</h2>
    <p>
      You are responsible for:
    </p>
    <p>
      • Configuring check-ins, escalation rules, and message content accurately<br />
      • Ensuring that contacts you designate have consented to receive messages<br />
      • Reviewing and maintaining your settings over time
    </p>

    <h2>Messages and content</h2>
    <p>
      You control the content of messages and disclosures created through the
      service. Cover Your Tails sends messages only according to your
      configuration and does not verify the accuracy or appropriateness of user-
      provided content.
    </p>

    <h2>No guarantees</h2>
    <p>
      Delivery of notifications and messages depends on device availability,
      network conditions, and third-party services. Cover Your Tails does not
      guarantee timely delivery or receipt of messages.
    </p>

    <h2>Limitation of liability</h2>
    <p>
      To the maximum extent permitted by law, Cover Your Tails shall not be liable
      for indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages arising from
      use of the service, missed notifications, or actions taken by contacts.
    </p>

    <h2>Account termination</h2>
    <p>
      You may stop using the service or delete your account at any time. We may
      suspend or terminate access if required to comply with law or to protect
      the integrity of the service.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to the service or terms</h2>
    <p>
      The service and these terms may evolve over time. Continued use of the app
      after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.
    </p>

    <h2>Governing law</h2>
    <p>
      These terms are governed by applicable laws based on the location of the
      service operator.
    </p>
