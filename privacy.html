    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>
      Cover Your Tails respects your privacy and is designed to collect and use
      only the information necessary to provide the features you configure.
    </p>

    <h2>Information we collect</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on how you use the app, we may collect:
    </p>
    <p>
      • Basic account information (such as phone number or email address)<br />
      • Phone numbers and names of contacts you choose to add<br />
      • Check-in schedules, preferences, and escalation settings you configure<br />
      • Message content you create for notifications or disclosures<br />
      • Optional location data, if you explicitly enable location features
    </p>

    <h2>How information is used</h2>
    <p>
      Information is used solely to:
    </p>
    <p>
      • Deliver scheduled check-ins and reminders to you<br />
      • Send notifications or messages when check-ins are missed, based on your
        pre-configured settings<br />
      • Release user-configured messages or information to designated contacts
        upon missed acknowledgments<br />
      • Support optional features you choose to enable
    </p>

    <h2>Location data</h2>
    <p>
      Location data is optional and disabled by default. Location information is
      collected or used only if you explicitly enable a location-based feature.
    </p>

    <p>
      Cover Your Tails does not continuously track your location. Location
      information is not shared with your contacts unless you explicitly configure
      the app to do so.
    </p>

    <h2>Contacts and messaging</h2>
    <p>
      Messages to contacts are sent only when a check-in is missed and only
      according to the rules and message content you configure in advance.
    </p>

    <p>
      You are responsible for ensuring that you have permission from any contacts
      you designate to receive messages through the service.
    </p>

    <h2>No emergency or medical services</h2>
    <p>
      Cover Your Tails is not an emergency response service, medical service, or
      monitoring service and does not contact emergency responders.
    </p>

    <h2>Data sharing</h2>
    <p>
      Cover Your Tails does not sell personal data. Information is shared only
      with service providers required to deliver app functionality, messaging,
      and notifications.
    </p>

    <h2>Data retention and deletion</h2>
    <p>
      Data is retained only as long as necessary to provide the service. Users
      may delete their account and associated data at any time. Some information
      may be retained temporarily as required for system operation or legal
      compliance.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>
      This privacy policy may be updated as the app evolves. Material changes
      will be reflected on this page.
    </p>
