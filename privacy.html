    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>
      Cover Your Tails respects your privacy and is designed to collect and use
      only the information needed to provide the app’s functionality.
    </p>

    <h2>Information we collect</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on how you use the app, we may collect:
    </p>
    <p>
      • Your phone number and basic account information<br />
      • Phone numbers and names of contacts you choose to add<br />
      • Check-in schedules and message content you configure<br />
      • Optional location data, if you enable location features
    </p>

    <h2>How information is used</h2>
    <p>
      Information is used solely to:
    </p>
    <p>
      • Deliver scheduled check-ins to you<br />
      • Send notifications or text messages when check-ins are missed, based on
        your pre-configured settings<br />
      • Support optional features you choose to enable
    </p>

    <h2>Location data</h2>
    <p>
      Location tracking is optional and disabled by default. If you enable
      location features, location data may be used to support app functionality
      you opt into.
    </p>

    <p>
      Location information is not shared with your contacts unless you explicitly
      configure the app to do so.
    </p>

    <h2>Consent and messaging</h2>
    <p>
      Messages to contacts are sent only when you miss check-ins and only according
      to the rules and message content you set in advance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Contacts are notified during setup that they have been added as a Cover Your
      Tails contact.
    </p>

    <h2>Data sharing</h2>
    <p>
      Cover Your Tails does not sell personal data. Information is shared only with
      service providers required to deliver messaging and app functionality.
    </p>

    <h2>Data retention</h2>
    <p>
      Data is retained only as long as needed to provide the service and may be
      deleted upon account removal.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>
      This privacy policy may be updated as the app evolves. Material changes will
      be reflected on this page.
    </p>
